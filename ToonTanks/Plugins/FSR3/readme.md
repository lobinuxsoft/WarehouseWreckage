# FidelityFX Super Resolution 3
The AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR3) plugin for Unreal Engine.

## Setup

To install the plugin:
1. Extract the zip file.
2. Place the FSR3 folder within your Unreal Engine source tree at: Engine/Plugins/Marketplace 
3. Open UnrealEditor.
4. Go to the Plugins window & enable FSR3
5. Restart.

## Usage
Temporal upsampling must be enabled in the `Project Settings > Rendering` or via the Console Variable `r.TemporalAA.Upsampling`.

FSR 3 can be enabled or disabled from the `Project Settings > FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 > Enabled`, or with the Console Variable `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.Enabled` in the configuration files - the variable can be modified at runtime *however* this is not guaranteed to be safe when other third-party upscalers are also enabled.

There are two backends for FSR3, one based on Unreal's RHI and a D3D12 native backend. 
The D3D12 backend supports asynchronous execution of frame interpolation and presentation that allows for superior performance and frame pacing, whereas the RHI backend executes frame interpolation serially without specific frame pacing but function on any platform supporting Shader Model 6.

By default the D3D12 backend is enabled, to use the RHI backend:
- Disable `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseNativeDX12` and enable `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseRHI`.

The plugin will use specific quality modes specified via `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.QualityMode` overriding `r.ScreenPercentage`.
The exposed modes are:
- **Native AA** : `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.QualityMode 0` <br>
Uses Super Resolution to perform temporal anti-aliasing without upscaling.

- **Quality** : `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.QualityMode 1` <br>
Produces a Super Resolution image which is nearly indiscernible from native rendering, and should be selected when image fidelity is paramount.

- **Balanced** : `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.QualityMode 2` <br>
Produces a Super Resolution image which is representative of native rendering, with minimal artifacts and sizeable performance gains.

- **Performance** : `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.QualityMode 3` <br>
Produces a Super Resolution image which approximates native rendering, with occasional artifacts but exceptional performance gains.

- **Ultra Performance** : `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.QualityMode 4` <br> 
Produces a Super Resolution image which may have notable artifacts under some conditions, and should be selected in situations where performance is critical.

## Frame Interpolation
Frame Interpolation is a new feature of FSR3. It requires FSR3 Upscaling to be enabled.

The FSR3 Frame Interpolation defaults to a D3D12 specific implementation that allows asynchronous execution of frame interpolation and frame pacing with or without VSync. 
For platforms that support Shader Model 6 there is also an RHI backend built on top of Unreal's RHI and Slate APIs. The RHI backend cannot perform proper frame-pacing so to get the best results `r.Vsync` must be enabled.

To use the RHI backend:
- Disable `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseNativeDX12` and enable `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseRHI`.

## Integration Instructions
FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 contains a built-in sharpening pass called RCAS that can be configured through the CVar `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.Sharpness`, this is disabled by default.  If your project has already integrated [FidelityFX-CAS](https://github.com/GPUOpenSoftware/UnrealEngine/tree/FidelityFXCAS-4.26), it may be necessary to disable FidelityFX CAS - including any in-game menu options - while `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.Sharpness` is enabled to prevent over-sharpening your final renders, and improve integration results. 

In order for FSR3 to process materials with World Position Offset and/or World Displacement correctly the `r.Velocity.EnableVertexDeformation` option must be enabled. The `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.ForceVertexDeformationOutputsVelocity` setting is enabled by default and when enabled FSR3 will force `r.Velocity.EnableVertexDeformation` on.
*For best results with Foliage assets that use World Position Offset and/or World Displacement select Moveable mobility to generate the necessary motion vectors.*

When `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.CreateReactiveMask` is enabled the FSR3 plugin forces `r.SSR.ExperimentalDenoiser` to 1 in order to capture the ScreenSpaceReflections, to handle this the initial value of `r.SSR.ExperimentalDenoiser` will be applied to `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseSSRExperimentalDenoiser`. Subsequent changes to the value of `r.FidelityFX.FSR3.UseSSRExperimentalDenoiser` will override this.

## Other Configurations
FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 has several additional CVars that can assist in meeting the needs of your project:
